/Simple presentation mode for Emacs Org-mode/

* About Fork

Note that this is a fork of the official version, which contains some of my own
fixes to various issues. I would like these to be merged into the official
version, but eschulte has been slow to respond to my pull requests, so I don't
have too much hope about that.

** Fixes

   (You can also get this list with more details by checking the commit log.)

   - Avoid redrawing everything on every page change (this is annoying and seems
     unnecessary.)

   - Make sure the presentation frame shows the intended buffer (this fixes a
     bug in case there is a hook in after-make-frame-functions that switches new
     frames to \*scratch\*.)

   - Remove deprecated macro org-re (my Emacs warned about this, but it doesn't
     say when it was deprecated, so I'm not sure this is a universally safe
     patch.)

   - Remove default F5/F12 keys to epresent-run (this overrides the custom keys
     I had bound; it is better if the user can pick their own keys for this.)

* Usage

- Call =epresent-run= on an org-buffer.
- press =t= / =1= to view the top level of the presentation
- navigate the presentation with =n/f=, =p/b=
- scroll with =k= and =l=
- use =c= and =C= to navigate between code blocks,
  =e= to edit them, =x= to make it run,
  and =s= / =S= to toggle their visibility
- quit with =q=
